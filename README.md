Important note: Due to confidentiality of the case study data used in the above report, the latter is not included in this repository. Therefore, the provided code, even if fully operational and reasonably bug-free with the data, and even if desribing all system dynamics as discussed in the report, will not run out-of-the-box without provision of data in the same format or changes in the input processing (see files stationMapUtrBijlAsdZShl.py, rocktData.py, rocktGateLine.py, rocktTrain.py, rocktTraveler.py, trentoData.py,
